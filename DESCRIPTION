Description: Provides an S3 data class to manage and annotate differential gene 
    expression (DGE) analysis results.  Although originally authored with DGE in mind, 
    the datatype is customizable and extensible to accommodate nearly any data analysis 
    workflow that starts from a data matrix of assays (rows) by samples (columns).
